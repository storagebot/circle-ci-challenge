# circle-ci-challenge

I built this app using [React][react], [Enzyme][enzyme] and [Jest][jest]. I also configured the repo with [CircleCI][circleci] for continuous integration and continuous deployment (with deployments going to [Heroku][heroku]).

**To see the app on Heroku, open http://circle-ci-challenge.herokuapp.com.**
